You can extract the zip file (Recommended to extract it in the desktop folder!) then go to the Durotto-final Folder.
There you will some files:
->mainwindow.cpp
->main.cpp
->mainwindow.h
->durottodatabase.db
->Durotto-final.pro
->Durotto-final.pro.user //You need to delete this file before getting started.
Then open the .pro file after that you will be directly redirected to QT.
#Database Connection
You need to follow some steps to connect your database:
1/Copy your local path of durottodatabase.db
2/Go to mainwindow.cpp, At the start of mainwindow parent you will see an existing database connection.
You have to replace it with your local path.
3/Then replace backslashes('\') with forwardslasesh('/').
Hopefully your databse is now connected.
Now book your Bus Tickets using our Durotto App.
//We are open for feedbacks.
